First Lab work
some of the results i have found while using same commands in different linux environment:
Most of the results are same in both machine.While I was doing ls command It will show repos only in CentOs and many in Ubuntu because there were many built in Directories in Ubuntu already.
when using listing commands Ubuntu contains many files than CentOs.while doing man ls command Ubuntu would give less description than in CentOs.

Thank you,
